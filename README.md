# ITUML5GChallenge_BuildaThon
This repository has the code developed for build a thon by RAN-RIC-xApp team
Team : RAN-RIC-xApp 



The pre-trained model, model specific and PRB allocation implementation for PRB developed by Team “AUTOMATO” as part of this build-a-thon is re-used in developing the below xApp. Please refer References [5] & [6] for details on report from Team “AUTOMATO”.

*Instructions 
1) Bring up RIC platform with Dawn release 
2) Bring up E2-SIM and get it registered with E2-Mgr/E2-term
3) Start Model Store
4) Create policy and policy Instances
5) First deploy the prbpred xApp and then deploy alloc xAPP 

Code is developed as per references [8] and [9].
